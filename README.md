I wanted to learn Swift. I also wanted to learn how base64 encoding works. Now I understand the latter and am just a tad less terrible at the former.

I know that there are base64 functions in Foundation and even a base64 utility in OS X but I wanted to implement the juicy part of radix 64 encoding myself. These kinds of concepts are easier for me to understand if I implement them from scratch.

I also want to take this opportunity to yet again denounce GNU, GPL and the FSF. They are a culture of brainwashing parasites on the permissive pillar of open source software that is fundamental to the further development of the information age. Do not let their follies of supposed freedom lure you into their restrictive domains.

Truly free and permissive,
